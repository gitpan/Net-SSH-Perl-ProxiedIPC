You can install this using in the usual Perl fashion

	perl Makefile.PL
	make
	make test
	make install

The documentation is in the module file.  Once you install
the file, you can read it with perldoc.

	perldoc Net::SSH::Perl::ProxiedIPC

If you want to read it before you install it, you can use
perldoc directly on the module file.

	perldoc  lib/Net/SSH/Perl/ProxiedIPC.pm
